# RPC System

Project 2 for COMP30023_2023_SM1 Computer Systems.

"In this project, you will be building a custom RPC system that allows computations to be split seamlessly between multiple computers. This system may differ from standard RPC systems, but the underlying principles of RPC will still apply. [...] You must write your own RPC code, without using existing RPC libraries."
