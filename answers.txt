*** Planning task ***

1. Should the server accept calls from everyone, or just a subset of users?
If the server accepted calls from everyone, malicious actors could perform DOS attacks by flooding the system with calls. Therefore, a "real world" RPC server should only accept calls from authenticated/trusted users. However, this particular project does not need to handle malicious actors and can therefore accept calls from everyone.

2. Should authentication etc. be provided by the RPC framework, or by the functions that use the RPC framework?
In both a "real world" server and in this project, authentication should be provided by the RPC framework so that it can provide authentication for all calls and responses. Furthermore, this authentication process would not need to know about the specific inner workings of individual functions.

3. What transport layer protocol should be used? What are the trade-offs?
In both a "real world" server and in this project, TCP should be used due to its reliability. The trade-off with using TCP is that it requires the creation and management of a connection. This can result in slower data transmission and increased overhead.

4. In which function(s) should the socket(s) be created?
A socket requires: Client IP, Client Port, Server IP, Server Port, Protocol
The protocol is constant.
"rpc_init_server" receives information for and sets up Server IP and Server Port.
"rpc_init_client"  receives information for and sets up Client IP and Client Port.
Therefore, the socket(s) will be created in the rpc_init_server and rpc_init_client functions in this project. A "real world" server would likely follow the same general idea with separate functions handling client and server information. 

5. Should rpc_client and rpc_server be allocated dynamically or statically? What are the implications for the client and server code?
In this project, "rpc_client" and "rpc_server" should both be allocated dynamically to provide more flexibility and better space efficiency.  However, this would mean that the client and server code would have to be able to handle generic (unspecified size) "rpc_client" and "rpc_server" data. It would also mean that memory would have to be freed on close. This would also be true for a "real world" RPC server.

6. What happens if one host uses big-endian byte order and the other uses little-endian? How does that relate to “network byte order”?
If hosts use different endian byte orders, information on one host will not match information communicated to the other. Using "network byte order" resolves this issue by enforcing big-endian byte order, regardless of the machine's architecture. This is true both in this project and in a "real world" RPC server. 


*** Protocol Description ***
Two types of requests:
FIND
Used to find a function given its name
Responds with <id:int> (or -1 if not found)
Usage: "FIND,<func_name:str>"
Eg: client sends: "FIND,add2"
    server responds: "0"

CALL
Used to call a function given its integer id
Responds with "<data1>,<data2_len>" followed by "<data2>" (or NULL if not found)
Usage: "CALL,<id:int>,<data1:int>,<data2_len:int>" followed by "<data2>"
Eg: client sends: "CALL,0,1,1" followed by "127"
    server responds: "128,0" [no <data2> since <data2_len> is zero]

TCP should be used as the transport protocol.
TCP
Pros: Reliable, most commonly used
Cons: Requires connections

UDP
Pros: Connectionless
Cons: Unreliable
